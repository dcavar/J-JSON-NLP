Java [JSON-NLP] Maven module and validator.

Brought to you by the [NLP-Lab.org].



## Introduction

There is a growing number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, modules, pipelines. There does not seem to be any standard for the output format. Here we are focusing on a standard for the output format syntax. Some future version of [JSON-NLP] might address the output semantics as well.

[JSON-NLP] is a standard for the most important outputs NLP pipelines and components can generate. The relevant documentation can be found in the [JSON-NLP] GitHub repo and on its website at the [NLP-Lab].


The Java [JSON-NLP] module is a representation class for the [JSON-NLP] standard implemented as a JSON Schema, available from the:

- [JSON-NLP GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcavar/JSON-NLP)

There is a corresponding Python module for [JSON-NLP]:

- [Python JSON-NLP GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcavar/Py-JSON-NLP)

[JSON-NLP] wrappers are available for numerous Python and Java based NLP components.
